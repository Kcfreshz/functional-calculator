# Functional Calculator Project

As a JavaScript beginner, a friend challenged me to code a functional calculator with what I have learned so far--HTML, CSS & JavaScript. He gave me a deadline but guess what I beat the deadline 😂. I looking forward to building more project and possibly get to land my first role in tech🙏🏾.
